<p class="texto1">The Spanish civil war was primarily caused by the division between Republicans and Nationalists. Other key factors include, economic struggles, caused because of the reform that the government made, which didn’t actually help people. Regional tensions and Nationalists in areas like Cataluña, which wanted bigger autonomy. On July 17, 1936, a military group led by Francisco Franco fought against the Republican government. This coup e’ tat was supported by fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, who saw the government as a threat to them.

The Nationalists ended up winning the war because they were more organized, since many of the soldiers came from the notorious army of Africa, so they had experience. The forces were better skilled and equipped than the Republican government, who were “chaotic”. There wasn’t a good or bad side in the war, large groups of people were on different sides. Republicans were supported by the soviet union and Nationalists by Nazi Germany. Franco ended up dictating Spain until his death in 1975. During Franco’s dictature, he committed numerous human rights abuse by creating concentration camps to kill and torture most people who were against his political and ideological opinions, causing about 200,000-400,000 deaths.

        <p>After the war, Frvados del conflictanco ended up dictating Spain from 1939 to 1975. During his regime, he declared multiple Fundamental laws (from 1942-1967) which declared Spain as a monarchy and settled a legislature known as the Cortes Españolas. The Cortes Españoles was the name of the legislative institution settled by Franco. Its main function was the development of other laws. These laws had a big similarity to Italian fascism. The main similarity of these 
    two was that they both shared the “themes” of Authoritarianism and Nationalism, which basically is a way of ruling that doesn’t involve personal freedom. Before dying, Franco chose Juan Carlos de Borbón to make him the head of the state. Almost immediately after becoming king, he started the process for Spain to become a democracy. The government also changed the name to General Courts, since Spain became a democracy.
